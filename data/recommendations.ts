    description: "How to adapt chicken diet depending on the season",
    content: `Seasonal feeding of chickens is an important aspect for maintaining stable egg production year-round.

WINTER:
- Increase the caloric content of the diet by 10-15%
- Add grain mixtures with high fat content to the feed
- Provide access to unfrozen water
- Add vitamin D if chickens don't have access to sunlight
- Evening feeding should be more abundant

SPRING:
- Gradually reduce the caloric content of the diet
- Increase protein content to 18%
- Add fresh greens as they become available
- Provide access to grit and oyster shells for strong eggshell formation

SUMMER:
- Ensure constant access to cool water
- Feed during cooler times of the day (morning and evening)
- Add more fresh greens to the diet
- Make sure the feed doesn't spoil in the heat

FALL:
- Gradually increase the caloric content of the diet
- Add more grains
- Use seasonal vegetables (pumpkin, zucchini, carrots)
- Begin preparation for the winter diet

Proper seasonal feeding will help maintain bird health and stable egg production throughout the year.`,

    description: "Essential measures to maintain the health of your flock",
    content: `Disease prevention in chickens is a key factor for maintaining high productivity.

BASIC PREVENTIVE MEASURES:

1. Housing Hygiene
- Regular cleaning of droppings (at least 1-2 times a week)
- Replacing bedding as it gets soiled
- Disinfection of premises and equipment (once a month)
- Control of rodents and insects

2. Vaccination
- Marek's disease (once at day-old)
- Newcastle disease (every 6 months)
- Infectious bronchitis (every 6 months)
- Consult with a veterinarian to create an individual vaccination schedule

3. Deworming
- Conduct preventive deworming every 3-4 months
- Use products recommended by a veterinarian
- Follow dosage and application method

4. Quarantine
- Isolate new birds for 2-3 weeks before introducing them to the main flock
- Observe the behavior and condition of the birds
- If disease is suspected, immediately isolate the sick individual

5. Balanced Nutrition

    content: `Creating optimal housing conditions for laying hens is key to high egg production.

KEY PARAMETERS:

1. Space
- Minimum 0.5 sq.m of floor space per chicken
- 20-25 cm of perch space per bird
- One nest box for every 4-5 hens
- Sufficient feeders and waterers (minimum 10 cm of feeder space per bird)

- Humidity: 60-70%
- Ventilation: ensure fresh air flow without drafts
- Lighting: 14-16 hours of light per day (critically important for egg laying)

3. Bedding
- Use dry sawdust, straw, or special bedding material
- Layer thickness: 5-10 cm
- Change as it becomes soiled
- Monitor for absence of mold and dampness

4. Nest Boxes
- Place in a darkened, quiet area
